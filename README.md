To use it copy all the contents of desired profile to a file called "thermal_engine.conf", backup and clear it first, this file is located at /system/etc folder and is responsible for control clocks and voltages according the setpoint of temperature, so, if you select a higher performance profile your phone will heat more, but if you select a lower performance value, will heat less.
